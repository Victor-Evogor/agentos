# AgentOS Demo Video - Voiceover Transcript

## 0:00 - The Hook
**(Visual: Fast-paced montage of the AgentOS Workbench UI, showing streaming text, tool calls, and the "AgentOS" logo glowing.)**

**Voiceover:**
Building autonomous agents shouldn't feel like hacking together loose scripts. It should feel like engineering intelligent systems.

Meet **AgentOS**. The modular orchestration runtime for adaptive AI agents.

## 0:15 - Introduction
**(Visual: The AgentOS Workbench "Compose" screen. Clean, dark, neon-drenched interface.)**

**Voiceover:**
Forget stateless functions. AgentOS introduces **Generalized Mind Instances**, or GMIs. These are persistent, context-aware entities that learn and evolve. 

And this... is the **AgentOS Workbench**. Your zero-config cockpit for inspecting, debugging, and orchestrating these minds.

## 0:35 - Personas & Context
**(Visual: User clicking the "Personas" tab in the sidebar. Selecting "Atlas - Systems Architect" from the list.)**

**Voiceover:**
It starts with **Personas**. An agent isn't just a prompt; it's a personality with distinct capabilities. Here, we're selecting "Atlas," our Systems Architect persona.

**(Visual: Typing a complex query into the chat composer: "Design a scalable microservices architecture for a fintech app.")**

**Voiceover:**
Watch as we engage Atlas. AgentOS handles the heavy lifting—streaming tokens in real-time, managing context windows, and maintaining the agent's unique voice.

## 0:55 - Tools & Capabilities
**(Visual: The agent stops generating text and a "Tool Call" block appears in the timeline. It executes `getCurrentDateTime` or similar.)**

**Voiceover:**
But agents need to *do* things. AgentOS provides a robust **Tool Orchestration** layer. 

**(Visual: A tool result appears: "Success". The agent continues generating based on the tool output.)**

**Voiceover:**
When Atlas needs information it doesn't have, it autonomously requests a tool execution. The Workbench visualizes this decision loop instantly—request, execution, result, and synthesis. Total transparency.

## 1:15 - Agencies (Multi-Agent Orchestration)
**(Visual: Switching to the "Agency" tab. Showing a graph or list of multiple agents: "Researcher", "Writer", "Reviewer".)**

**Voiceover:**
One agent is powerful. A team is unstoppable. 

With **Agencies**, you can coordinate multiple GMIs into a collective. Define roles, set goals, and watch them collaborate.

**(Visual: The "Agency overview" panel in the timeline. "Live telemetry" badge pulsing. Multiple personas appearing in the timeline stream.)**

**Voiceover:**
The Workbench gives you a god-mode view of the entire operation. You see the handoffs, the message bus events, and the state of every agent seat in the agency—all in a single, unified timeline.

## 1:40 - Developer Experience & Telemetry
**(Visual: Clicking "Stream debug" to expand raw JSON logs. Showing the "Telemetry" side panel with token counts and latency.)**

**Voiceover:**
For the builders, we've built deep observability right in. Track token usage, latency, and debug raw stream chunks without leaving the interface. It's the "IDE" your agents deserve.

## 1:55 - Conclusion
**(Visual: AgentOS Logo on a black background. Website URL: agentos.sh)**

**Voiceover:**
Adaptive intelligence. Streaming-first runtime. Enterprise-grade orchestration.

This is AgentOS.
